# Zanders-Portfolio-V1

## Description

This module challenge was to build my first portfolio from scratch.  During this excersize I got to practice the new advanced HTML and CSS skills that I have been learning at the start of Bootcamp.  As I learn and refine my coding skills I will be making updates to the layout and design of this portfolio.  Eventually I hope to use this portfolio to showcase all of my Bootcamp work as well as individual projects to catch the eye of potential employers.
